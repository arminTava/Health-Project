# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here

The refactored code is based on the "early return pattern". This is explained in more detail below:

JavaScript's early return pattern encourages clear and readable code by reducing the number of nested conditional statements. It involves returning early from a function when a certain condition is met, instead of continuing with the rest of the function's code.

Utilizing the early return pattern has the following advantages for this use case:

- Readability: The code becomes more linear and simpler to understand by returning early from the function when a condition is satisfied. It eliminates the use of unnecessary nesting, which reduces developers' workload.
- Simplicity: By dividing the function into smaller logical chunks, the early return pattern minimizes the complexity of the code.
- Maintainability: With a simpler and more readable code structure, it becomes easier to understand and modify the function in the future.
